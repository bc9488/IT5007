 Tutorial 6
 
 I cant get my set-up to work for the android studio, keep troubleshooting with 
 android studio and even xcode. But still cant seem to work.
 
 I put in the backend code from my tutorial 5, and for the front-end i change
 the jsx to the react-native components, but i not sure if it works.
